# introduce-myself
I am just a newbie in coding 
I learned to code in 7th grade. First, I really wanted to make a game, so I studied Ren'py, then I enjoyed more and learned C++. But it was just a leisure. Now, I will
choose career soon, so that I have continued to go coding hard. Because I want to know coding is suitable for my last decistion.
